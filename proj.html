      <p>A wise man once said “Beware of little expenses. A small leak will sink a great ship.” The US national debt is the total amount of outstanding borrowed money the government has accumulated over time, for every year the US spends more money than it earns, the result is a budget deficit. Every year the federal government runs a deficit, and the national debt grows as a result of the increasing amount of money borrowed. Without borrowing money, however, the government could not fund basic programs and public services critical to Americans’ health, welfare, and security. Throughout this project, we will learn at what percentage rate the national debt has increased from 1960 to 2015 and see the differences between the first decade and the last decade.  We will also learn about the US national debt in 2018 and 2019,  also see some graphs for the following information and why they have been chosen. And we will try to predict the national debt for the years 2020 and 2021. </p>

      <p>The US national debt for 55 years period, between 1960 to 2015. The US national debt has increased with a ratio of 7,546% continuous compound interest every year. In reality, the growth rate has varied over time depending on several factors. As we can notice from the table above, the U.S. government has made more 3 times more debt in the last decade than in the first decade due to some events that marked the US history like the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and the 2008 Great Recession.  The interest rate of the first decade (1960-1970) was 2.6% and the percentage rate for the last decade (2005-2015) it was 8.2% which is 3.2 times more. </p>
      <p>The amount of the national debt for the year 2018 is 21,516 billion dollars and 22,719 billion dollars for the year 2019. For more details click in that link below:</p>

      <p>As we can observe from the graph above, there was a drop in the year 2013 because the 2013 goods and services deficit was the lowest since 2009 and 2013 exports of goods and services were the highest on record.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>In my opinion, the appropriate type of model that fits this data is exponential because that demonstrates the process in which the US national debt increases at a fixed percentage rate (7.546%) over a specific interval of time (1960-2015).</p>

      <p>If the US national debt keeps increasing at the same percentage rate of 7.546%, the national debt should be 26,465 billion dollars of debt in 2020 and 28,539 billion dollars in 2021.</p>

      <p>Throughout this activity, I learned a lot of things such as how to use Excel to do graphs, the US national debt history, how to interpret an exponential graph, how to predict the future using mathematics, and how to code using HTML and CSS.  To accomplish this activity I faced a lot of challenges such as coding in HTML and CSS, I used to do some basic coding in HTML but I never went that far. This has helped me a lot, I think I will use this knowledge for many other purposes. This activity has made me appreciate mathematics more than I used to because it demonstrates how mathematics is involved in anything that’s happening in a country. I have been always a lover of mathematics and computer that’s why I chose computer science as my major therefore this makes me have more appreciation for the following skills, I realized how importance my major will be in the future </p>
